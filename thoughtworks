coding round Quentions
1: 1. Coding : I was asked to write a code to display the words of a sentence in alphabetical order.
Ex: Input: Hi How Are You
Output: Are Hi How You

import java.util.*;
 
public class AscendingWords {
 
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // Accept input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter String: ");
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        // Add a space at end of input String
        input = input + " ";
        // Find number of words
        int numberOfWords = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
            char ch = input.charAt(i);
            if (ch == ' ') {
                numberOfWords++;
            }
        }
        // Extract words and store in array
        String[] words = new String[numberOfWords];
        int startIndex = 0;
        int currentWord = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
            char ch = input.charAt(i);
            if (ch == ' ') {
                String word = input.substring(startIndex, i);
                words[currentWord] = word;
                currentWord++;
                startIndex = i + 1;
            }
        }
        // Sort words
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < words.length - i - 1; j++) {
                if (words[j].compareTo(words[j + 1]) > 0) {
                    String temp = words[j];
                    words[j] = words[j + 1];
                    words[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        // Print words
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(words[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}

2. Technical Interview: General Testing Interview Questions, real life Scenarios to test.
--Difference between Verification and Validation.
Verification is the process of evaluating products of a development phase to find out whether they meet the specified requirements.	
Validation is the process of evaluating software at the end of the development process to determine whether software meets the customer expectations and requirements.
The objective of Verification is to make sure that the product being develop is as per the requirements and design specifications.	
The objective of Validation is to make sure that the product actually meet up the user’s requirements, and check whether the specifications were correct in the first place.

--Difference between severity, priority
Priority is associated with scheduling, and “severity” is associated with standards.

“Priority” means something is afforded or deserves prior attention; a precedence established by order of importance (or urgency).

“Severity” is the state or quality of being severe; severe implies adherence to rigorous standards or high principles and often suggests harshness; 
severe is marked by or requires strict adherence to rigorous standards or high principles, e.g. a severe code of behavior.

--Difference between sanity and regression testing
Smoke Testing: Software Testing done to ensure that whether the build can be accepted for through software testing or not. 
Basically, it is done to check the stability of the build received for software testing

Sanity testing: After receiving a build with minor changes in the code or functionality, a subset of regression test cases are executed that to 
check whether it rectified the software bugs or issues and no other software bug is introduced by the changes.

--Difference between Stress and Load testing
Load Testing : This measures the response time when the application is subjected to more than usual load. 
The application will be slower under heavy load, but the aim of load testing is to see whether the 
application can sustain the increased load on the server or will it crash and kill the servers

Stress Testing : Stress Testing is like load testing but we keep on increasing the load on the server till the time it crash down. 
The aim of stress testing is to test the insane limits of an application

--Automate a scenario using selenium ( write the script)
-- How will you test a vending machine (All kinds of test cases, and also the types of testing you can apply)
Test Scope : 
1) Functional test pass 
What type of coins does the vending machine accept? 
Verify what type power input does vending machine handle?(Voltage) 
Verify what is the capacity of the vending machine 
Verify what type of food does it contains? 
2) Stress Testing: 
Verify that at what level vending machine stops accepting orders? 
3) Load testing 
verify what is the threshold of the machine 
4) Usability testing 
verify who will use this machine i.e what is the age group 
5) Security testing : 
Verify what type of security concerns you want to capture? 
6) Performance testing : 
How many transacactions does this machine handles in a day? 
7) Acceptance testing 
how would user get money back if there is a problem in machine

-- Test a website ( the webservice/API)
-- Puzzle 1: there are 2 containers 3L and 5L capacity. You can use as much water as you want.How will you get 4 L water using the 2 containers.
First pour 5 liter of water in 3 liter container .... now you will have 2 liter remaning in 5 liter...now empty the 3 liter and fill it with 2 liter from the 5 lit container..... now take 5 liter and pour one more liter to 3 liter container ...now you are left with 4 liter in 5 liter container

--Puzzle 2: there are 8 identical balls, out of them one is overweight. In how many minimum passes( using a weight machine) can you find out the overweight ball?

3. Technical Interview: Very very detailed questions about how you did automation in your previous project and what exactly you did everyday during your previous work. ( Can only be answered if you have actually done automation in the project, basically I think they want to check whether you have actually got hands on experience or have faked it in your resume.)
--How to test an automatic door in a mall
--Puzzle 1: there are 8 identical balls, out of them one is overweight or underweight ( you dont know which). In how many minimum passes( using a weight machine) can you find out the defective ball?  

Interview

First Round (Telephonic)
Questions on Java .
Scenarios for testing an e commerce site .
Second Round(Some kind of test- non technical )
Trust me it is difficult
Third Round (F-F)
Explain test automation framework . they look for Page object reference model .
Write a program for String reverse and validate whether it is palindrome or not .
Fourth Round
How will you test whether the problem is with the third party s/w or your product .
Count of occurrences of a pattern in a file
Some shares and stocks game to be tested

Verify that an array, when flipped 180 degrees, is still the same. e.g [1,6,0,9,1] = [1,9,0,6,1]
