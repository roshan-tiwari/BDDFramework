# BDDFramework
Roshan's BDD Framework
# The main motto of the framework is have one small working BDD framework.
# To write the cucumber(gherkin code) I have made separate directory where it will have all the feature files.
# I have setup my junit runner file which tells the cucumber where my selenium-java code is present which is called as "Step definations"
# In junit file I have integrate "Cucumber Extent Reports" to have the report task.
# Usually code snippets is implemented for the cucumber feature file but what I have is write the utilities in "Utilities" directory. It will be having all the commmon and re-usabel code which will make easy to write my gherkin/business scenarios.
# I have setup property file where it will be having some configuration required in framwork.
# For continuos integration I have steup Jenkins in my local port 8080.
# To push/pull the code to GITHUB account I have intalled and configured GIT.
